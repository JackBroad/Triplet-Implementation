The data in 'coexistenceDensity' were generated using the 124-atom position file in the 'Triplet-Implementation' directory. In the 18 A box used, the data correspond to a density of ~1.4 kg/L.

The data in 'highDensity' were generated using the 500-atom position file in 'Triplet-Implementation' directory. In the 18 A box, the data are for a (ludicrously high!) density of ~5.9 kg/L.

The higher density emphasises the speed-up, whereas the lower density shows the speed-up for a realistic simulation density.
